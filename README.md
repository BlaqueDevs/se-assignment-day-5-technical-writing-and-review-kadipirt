 "Ensuring Reliable Medication Data with FDA Validation"
 "How AI is Changing Healthcare" (Too broad, doesn‚Äôt relate directly to MediLingo+ features)
9. Don‚Äôt Overuse or Underuse Headings
 Too many headings can make the document feel fragmented.
 Too few headings make it hard to skim or find information.

 Balance Example:

 Sections every 2‚Äì5 paragraphs (Ideal)
 A new heading every 1‚Äì2 sentences (Too much)
 One heading for a full page of text (Not enough)
10. Use Headings to Highlight Key Takeaways
If a section contains critical insights, use the heading to emphasize it.

 Example:
Instead of:
 "Data Validation" (Generic)
Use:
 "How MediLingo+ Ensures FDA-Approved Medication Data" (More informative)
